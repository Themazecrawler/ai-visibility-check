## The fix
1. **Real fix:** Render these pages on the server: move data fetching into Server Components / getStaticProps, and avoid 'use client' wrappers around the whole page.
2. **Quick fix:** upload the generated `page.md` to your site at `/index.html.md`, and list it in your site's `/llms.txt` index.
3. **Point to it:** paste this in your page's `<head>`. It sits in the raw HTML, so crawlers that skip JavaScript still see it:

```html
<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown" href="/index.html.md" title="Text version for AI tools">
```

Note: no AI company has confirmed its crawler reads llms.txt or .md copies of pages. The real fix (1) is the only guaranteed one.
